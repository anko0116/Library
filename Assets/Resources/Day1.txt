Text	/	Home to daydreamers, deadbeats, housewives, whores, salarymen, swindlers, aristocrats, addicts, grandmas, gamblers, poets, panhandlers, and every supernatural and super natural thing that can be possibly packed into the smallest galaxy ever.	intro_space2
Text	/	It is also home to deli drive-ins, mom-and-pop dollar shops, bowling alley beer bottles, and street corners of cigarette ashes scattered across billions of planets: enough to call the whole place “Smokers’ Galaxy.”	intro_space1
