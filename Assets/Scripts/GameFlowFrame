Things to watch out for:
- Saving and loading game (certain checkpoints?)
    - Checkpoints:
        - "Open Library"
        - "Close Library"
        - "Store"
        - "Home"
- format of our XML files
    - Things to store:
        - Current location (Library? Store? Cutscene? Home)
        - Character name
        - Character border?
        - Character name's color?
        - Character's dialogues
        - In-dialogue specifics
            - Different-timed pauses
    <Day>
    Gameplay
    <Location> <-- this indicates change of location
        Library

        Store
        Home
    </Location>

- Books that characters will give


Interaction Framework:
    1. NPC walks in
    2. Dialogue back and forth
    -  Another NPC enters
    3. Gameplay (Retrieving or Organizing books)
    4. Repeat from #2 until END 

Example Day:
    Open Library (organizing gameplay?)
    Interaction-1
    Interaction-2
    ...
    Interaction-n
    Close Library (organizing gameplay?) <- maybe not needed for closing
    Store (Dodi's)
    Home (Hot tub time!)


Day 1:
    Cutscene - Opening/Intro (Smoky Galaxy...) with arts and texts
    Black screen
    "Open eyes" animation
    Interaction-Dodi,Pip
    Interaction-Milo
    Interaction-Dodi
